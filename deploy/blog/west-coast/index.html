    <h1>Day 1</h1>
    <p>Not really international travel or even a weekend to Melbs, but i havnt been here in years and it definitely feels like travel, so i thought id write a few words.</p>
    <p>Martie and i are on a journey of discovery. Braving the west coast for the first time since we were younguns with a car full of cameras and paint. Our first stop is Queenstown - but not without first driving the scenic route. Or as were calling it, the Tassie power plant scenic trail. En route to Queenstown we stopped at 3 of the 5 we saw from a distance. The first was the most impressive, Repulse Power Station - about an hour and a half out of Hobart. The place was completely deserted - with bullet holes visible through the command centre windows atop the huge concrete dam. We had a poke around, took a bunch of photos etc. The back wall of the dam had a surprising amount of graffiti on it - some fairly old. Along with a big roller tag that said 'Slip Ham' followed by another word that we couldn't rally read… whatever that means. You could hold a rave there and i doubt you'd be disturbed… The architecture and feel of the place reminded me of soviet bunker photos dug up from the 60s and 70s. Before starting our ascent into the highlands, we went past Black Bobs river. Next to the river was a collection of sheet metal, rusting cars and mouldy wood that someone called a home... This brought to mind some fairly well known Tassie tales of woe, needless to say we hurried on fairly quickly.</p>
    <p>As we went higher and higher into the hills and mountains, substations, huge powerlines, man made rivers and other powereplant related infrastructure seemed to pop up more and more frequently. It was quite bizarre as apart from these relics of our human existence, the land and nature was completely untouched. But even the powerlines eventually petered out and we were left with raw uninterrupted vegetation split in two by the road. Mountains peaked with snow and golden marshes at their feet sprawled out either side of us sometimes obscured by sections forrest as we defended into gullies. Each section of forrest was completely different, from beautiful twisted white gum groves to thick scrub hiding ancient trees to wet sparse rain forrest. It was beautiful. Needless to say the journey took twice as long due to ample photo opportunities.</p>
    <p>The highlight for me was a lookout about a kilometre from Frenchmans cap - on the further end of Victoria Pass. The light was low and there was rain in the distance so there was a beautiful orange light fading into blue clouds over the range of mountains before us [the picture of mart and the car is at said lookout].</p>
    <p><a href="http://jonnyscholes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/DSC_1476.jpg"><img src="http://jonnyscholes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/DSC_1476.jpg" alt="" title="DSC_1476" width="600" height="398" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-59" /></a></p>
    <p>After winding our way through Victoria pass, and the foothills that lead to the Queenstown decent it was beginning to get dark. As we approached Queenstown we went past a burnt down cafe [that looked like the set of a bad 90s horror film] and were then thrown into a twisting drive towards some lights we could see through the fog. The drive down into Queenstown was nothing short of frightening - pissing down with rain, 20m vision at the best of times and to our left, a very steep road downwards and a sheer drop to our left that fell into, as far as we could tell… complete nothingness. It would make the perfect opening to a movie.</p>
    <p>Once in Queenstown it was nightfall, the place was fairly deserted save a hopeful taxi and a few drunken youths stumbling their way to the town centre. More on them later. We went to the first pub we could find, booked a room and had a meal of lamb chops, which were surprisingly good and well priced. From our table we could see we were the only guests dining here tonight, and we were treated to a sight of the locals drinking heavily and gambling their money away 2 dollars at a time. Iv seen gamblers before, while at the cas in Hobart, but this was quite a wake up to how some people live [weather or not they wish to or should im not commenting on, its their life not mine]. The people at the pokies were completely hooked - one even going as far as finishing dinner early, leaving her friends to finish and jogging back to the still warm perch she had minutes earlier affront a flashing wheel of hope. It was quite depressing.</p>
    <p>After scoffing down our dinner and leaving the dining room at our motel we ventured across the road to the other pub. En route we were greeted with a car full of youths drinking and swearing indiscriminately while a gaggle of clearly underage teen girls giggled at their manliness [just guessing here…] - on our approach the car flung its self round the corner with a round of cheers from the girls [and what seemed to be a 12 year old boy with a smirnoff double black in his hand] - the sound of bottles smashing down the road followed the over revs of the maroon tinted commodore. With this image in our mind we entered the Imperial Hotel where we were met with one of the more sorry looking pubs iv ever drunk in. No music and a lone patron graced their benches - but this place had a pool table so we were set. Or so we thought… until we were told there was a $10 deposit on cue sticks to stop the locals from wrapping them around each others heads. This wasn't exactly inspiring but we played on, with the 'underagers' [as they were referred to] at the window gnashing their teeth or waving frantically… clearly trying to get the attention from an outsider who may have some secrets of the real world to share. We were, for a while there, genuinely concerned for our safety and were told that it may be best to head for our hotel before 9.30 when apparently 'everyone' would pour onto the street and drift between the two pubs. We took this advice and went for a few more beers at the pub we were staying adjacent to before retiring early to our room to look through our photos and plan for the next day.</p>
    <p>Great day, a good start to the trip. Amazing scenery and infrastructure, and an insight into a world i would struggle to live in. Sitting down to an amazing breakfast [and so cheap!!!] before setting out on day 2 to see what else we can find…</p>
    <p>Adieu!</p>
    <p>-Jonny</p>
    <p>p.s. i forgot to add, i was awoken at around 2am to the sound of yet more bottles, angry voices and numerous rounds 'oi caaarrrrnt, git tha fuck back ere'…. Golden.</p>
    <h1>Day 2</h1>
    <p>After having an amazing breakfast of eggs, sausages, bacon, tomato, mushroom and hollandaise Martie and I set out to explore Queenstown by day. Despite the stares from disgruntled [or confused?] locals, it was a lot less ominous than the night before. Since the last time i was there it had changed a lot. Most noticeably were the surrounding hills and mountains, 9 years ago when i was there with my family every single slope you could see was completely bare. It looked like a scene from mars. Since then a lot of regrowth has popped up and save for the hills still being mined, it was for the most part, green.</p>
    <p><a href="http://jonnyscholes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/DSC_0263.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-63" title="DSC_0263" src="http://jonnyscholes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/DSC_0263.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="399" /></a></p>
    <p>We walked around the town stopping here and there to take photos - doing the tourist thing. We stumbled across a huge mural on the side of a warehouse which was done with roller paint - it was incredibly well executed and the colours were amazing. Apart from that, the place was pretty run down. The left overs from recent house fires were still evident, and more houses were for lease or sale than not. I think the resident OH&amp;S officer had either moved on to the next town or fallen asleep for the last 15 years because most buildings on the main strip were definitely in need of structural repair - it made the recent collapse at my house in Pottery road look like a bent nail in comparison. And yet they were all still in use.</p>
    <p>We joked the night before about how empty it was - despite the numerous youths and their older mates honing and gooning - but the daytime was just as deserted, if not more so. A lone walker here and another tourist traveling at the wrong time of the year there - iv never seen a town this big with so fewer people! Unless they were scared of us outsiders and were perched behind their curtains scathing in secret, i would say its all a phrase and there are in fact NO responsible adults in the town, only hung over youths by day and rowdy drunken ones by night.</p>
    <p>After determining just how derelict the town was by doing a quick drive by the burbs [seriously, the definition of a birthday present in this place is tagging the lucky bastards front wall with a depressingly illegible note of affection]. We decided to get the fuck out and so drove further north towards Strahn. Perhaps one of the nicest parts of driving yet, me and mart couldn't stop exclaiming at the rapid change in vegetation as we drove north. Ill stop here before describing the scenery to say - I FUCKING LOVE WEST COAST ROADS. If anyone from the HCC or other southern councils reads this, get onto the west coast councils and ask who does their roads, then hire them. Now. The fact that the roads are cantered correctly and predominately made from quartz not blue stone made the place feel a lot more European [ala the roads on the coast of Great Britain or in lower France] - especially when driving through areas which had a large pine tree population mixed in with the natural vegetation [theres a heap of plantations around this area, some of them have seemingly gone wild now - or the seeds have spread to the natural forrests].</p>
    <p><a href="http://jonnyscholes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/DSC_0248.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-64" title="DSC_0248" src="http://jonnyscholes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/DSC_0248.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="399" /></a></p>
    <p>Back to the drive, our first stop was just out of Queenstown. We definitely didn't feel like we were in Tassie here, more like the oil fields of Texas but with white sand and nothing but the brownish black pollution without the mining hammer looking things. It was incredibly alien. Fires had clearly swept through in recent years, leaving absolutely nothing. The only green was moss and a small amount of regrowth grass. Strewn amongst the charcoal and stained sand were a myriad of rusty objects from years of youths burning cars and blowing up jerry cans with shotguns. It was quite the spectacle. After shooting a few rolls of film, and a bazillion dig shots, we moved on. Driving through yet another windy road to Strahn. It took a lot shorter than we should [and perhaps should, but hey, new car iv gotta test it out somewhere]. We soon found ourselves driving amongst a much prettier collection of buildings and then along the foreshore of what must be one of the cutest towns in Tasmania. I doubt a set maker from hollywood could do a better job of creating a scape of old facades and relics of a past much more industry based lifestyle.</p>
    <p><a href="http://jonnyscholes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/DSC_0177.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-65" title="DSC_0177" src="http://jonnyscholes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/DSC_0177.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="903" /></a></p>
    <p>We drove right through Strahn and found ourselves at an old cemetery which shed a more sombre light on some of the people who had lived here in the past. The thing that interested me was the way you could tell how wealthy the family was from their grave. Backed by an amazing view of Maquarie harbour, this would be a beautiful place to call your last port of call. Perhaps ill put it in my will. We trekked through the surrounding bush, finding an old burnt out car and the wreckage of an old train line on the rocks net to the water. After picking through the bits and pieces, and struggling up the cliff face to the car we headed to the dunes north of Strahn. En route we were treated to a beautiful view of pine trees being logged badly hidden behind a buffer of trees. Turning left towards the sea we took of our shoes and sock to run up the sand dunes. Running up sand is no mean feat, especially when these dunes are as high as the trees being felled less than a hundred meters away. Once at the top we arrived to discover good and bad news. The good was the AMAZING view of countless dunes between us and the sea, which stretched on for miles and miles stopping only when it reached Africa - that was a cool feeling. The bad however, was that the rain had made all the sand rock solid and sticky. No flying down the dunes at high speed for us :( So with our tails between our legs we missioned back and found the local YHA where we are now munching down a well earned steak before heading to the local pub for a few brews.</p>
    <p>Another great day, another stretch of land explored. If anyone reading hasn't vistit this side of the isle, shame on you. Its freaking amazing.</p>
    <p>Peace and whiskers Tasweigions,</p>
    <p>-Jonny</p>
    <p>p.s. Three notes from the night out in Strahn:</p>
    <p>1. The main pub here is awesome. Really friendly people [unlike Queenstown], the pool cues aren't behind the bar and the walls are covered with fantastic local photos.</p>
    <p>2. Although Strahn is waaaay better than Queenstown, they still havnt worked out that fences are good for keeping your dog on your property… as martie found out last night when a beast of a dog came pelting at him out of the darkness. We both came close to wetting ourselves…</p>
    <p>3. It is one of the most photogenic towns iv ever been in. Just about every frame you take could be a print. We took full advantage of this.</p>
