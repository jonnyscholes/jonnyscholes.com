    <h1>Day 1</h1>
    <p>After an 8 hour flight form Hobart to Denpasar [via Sydney urgh]. The flight was a lot nicer than i expected - the international airlines have upgraded their entertainment facilities a LOT since i last flew - much to the enjoyment of me and my brother.</p>
    <p>As soon as we landed we felt the drastic change in weather - funnily enough, it was about the same time as we  all started to complain about the heat. Customs was nothing like it had been hyped up to be - they had no care in the world that half our locks were broken upon arrival and merely laughed us through! To everyones dismay our airline managed to lose Linden's surfboard - the one he made himself and i painted. We're awaiting a call to see weather or not its turned up - no one wishes to endure the wrath of an angry Linden so for their sake i hope by the next post i can bring news of its arrival.</p>
    <p>Once we were in the Taksi [thats how they spell it here :D ] it was like being on the set of The Fast and The Furious: Bali Traffic Edition. The road rules are basically swerve THEN let people know your there - usually by yelling out the window or leaning on the horn excessively - it made the hour trip to the palace were staying in quite memorable. Weve found out that getting alicense here is as easy as paying for a license and 'proving' that your 16 - though its obvious how little the police care about kids on bikes here when half of the riders look no older than 9 or 10!</p>
    <p>After arriving at the palace - which is AMAZING [ill add pictures later] - we went for a short walk to a local restaurant called the Lotus where we had THE best satay ever to grace the earth and sampled the local micro brew [which is called 'Bali Micro Brew' creative right?] the Golden Ale tastes very similar to a Squires golden ale... except its lighter on the stomach and is delicious. Also most alcohol content stickers have either %5&amp;lt; or %5&amp;gt; ie above or below %5 - never an exact amount as far as i can tell.</p>
    <p>On the walk home Linden and I got our first chance to stroll around, enjoy all the random stores that are open 24 hours and strike up some chatter in broken English with Taksi drivers.</p>
    <p>So far - 24 odd hours in - Bali has been amazing. I came here expecting it to be very touristy - which in many ways it is - but its not hard to walk off the beaten track 10m or so and find yourself immersed in the untouched culture of the region. Everyone i have met has been amazingly kind - there is no sense of 'your a tourist - im a local' theyre just happy to chat and maybe sell you something.</p>
    <p>Thats it for today/tonight ill add another post tomorrow!</p>
    <p>Peace!</p>
    <h1>Day 2</h1>
    <p>Me and linden woke up at 7am and went for a mission around the   surrounding village [11.30am Hobart time :p]. It looks 100% different   than at night. At night there are heaps of clothes shops that wed all   know very well [billabong, just jeans etc] where as in the day its all   local markets, make shift stalls, 4 or 5 shops operating out of the same   space - all competing for the same customers! We quickly spent our   700'000 Rps [$70] on various gimmicky gifts, food that often went   uneaten [we never really knew what we were buying], red bull that   dissolves your tongue and by giving it out to people who smiled for the   camera [although there's no shortage of models lining up for a snap].</p>
    <p>The  markets themselves were hectic and cramped, from the street it  looks  like a line of two or three shops selling a multitude of things.  Once  you step in side though, doorways appear out of nowhere enticing  you through to other stalls and spaces filled crammed with  "stuff". The  more doors you went through the more that seemed to open  up - i say  doors, though more often than not it was a hole in a wall. The catacomb  of goods got more and more interesting as i ventured in. The smells that  assaulted my nose changed so frequently i never got a chance to work  out exactly what the smell was - none necessarily good or bad smells,  but it was a distinctly memorable part of the day. The stall owners  bustled and sprooked constantly all competing for my brothers and my  attention [and money]. Linden got straight into haggling down [or up!]  prices of a backpack and some fruit meanwhile i wandered around taking portraits of the locals at work. The kids loved my camera exclaiming "big camera, big big!" or "take my photo, your camera will love my pecks" to which the boy pinches mine and then his nipples - it was a fantastic exchange. The older men and women mostly seemed puzzled that i was taking photos of their trash or scrawny street dogs but never said no to a photo when approached - though the polici weren't so keen on me photographing their car so we politely moved on through the market.</p>
    <p>[nggallery id=1]</p>
    <p>Later on when the full group went back to the market we took it a little slower and covered more of the merchandise maze. Unlike earlier when Lin and I went through we were thronged by sellers as soon as we left the palace gates. Dad [Roger] and I fought our way through the crowd and down into a 'pit' where all the locals shopped and bartered their goods. It was a completely different vibe. No one asked you to buy something or for money, they just did their own thing while i did mine. I managed to have some conversations with the few people about their lives here. In the locals market people spoke very little English, I guess most of the people who can speak English work in the tourist market. Most said that it was a beautiful place to live and that they loved their lives , but that they wished they had more money for 'other things'. The locals mainly live off their land and what they can trade for. The money they can get they spend on things like cigarettes, beer, petrol, shoes, lollies - and not much else. Its an interesting way of life compared to Tassie or other places iv visited - and one i admire in many ways i think the west could learn a lot from the way village communities run.</p>
    <p>After returning from the market we headed to a restaurant for lunch where i had THE BEST Mi Goreng iv ever had. You will most defiantly see me there again tomorrow. And maybe the next day. And the n... anyway, after lunch we headed back down the main street waiting for a cremation ceremony wed been told about to start. Sure enough, before we had time to work out what was going on, a bamboo tower decorated with colored fabric and painted carvings burst into view dancing at the shoulders of 30 or so men dressed in white shirts and sarongs. Atop the tower was an alcove where the woman being cremated lay in a strikingly plain white box with a gold trim.  The procession - tower being hauled by a group of men, a group of younguns with symbols and gongs, family members, police, fire brigade and kids who didn't really seem to know what was going  on - but were loving it. As the tower rocked its way down the street it was met by power lines and telephone cables which were nonchalantly wacked or lifted aside by long bamboo poles manned by men dressed in black. All the tourists flinched and scattered from the men as they did this - clearly oblivious to the words instilled into every westerners mind - DONT TOUCH POWER LINES. Clearly Bali didn't get that memo - oops!</p>
    <p>After a lot of yelling, beeping, crashing and wobbling the tower got to the temple where the cremation was to be held. What ensued was without a doubt one of the more amazing few hours of my life. Ill point out now that we were following only one of two towers heading to the temple. One carried a woman who had recently died, and the other a man who was this womans partner. He had been buried a few weeks ago and was dug up to be cremated along side his life long love. The temple had a structure built in its courtyard to hold the bodies after they were moved from the tower to be cremated. As they were being put into the cow and bull shaped furnaces family and friends put gifts at the foot of the alter on which the structure was built. Opposite from where i sat i could see the family holding a photo of their loved ones while they chattered and smoked cloves. They were quietly smiling as the alter slowly filled with gifts and decorations from the village. After everyone had laid their gifts, the bodies had been transferred and the fuel had been placed a man from the family was approached and given a torch to start the fires. The fires burnt through the structure and spread to the towers until they slowly collapsed in on each other and the bodies were hidden from view. It was a fantastic spectacle - and moved me almost to tears. The vibe of joy was paramount throughout the ordeal but at the same time everyone had an unspoken respect for the two passing from this world for the next - this ceremony wasn't a day of sadness, it was a day of celebration. A celebration not only of the lives led by the couple - but also of the community.</p>
    <p>It was a jam packed day, all 6 of my senses [no thats not a type] were working overtime to keep me immersed in a culture so drastically different from my own. I cant wait for tomorrow brings - but i need some sleep. So adieu and sweet dreams Earth.</p>
    <p>Peace.</p>
    <h1>Day 3</h1>
    <p>Day three was a massive day. I didn't goto sleep until 5am this morning as i was out and about wandering with the locals. I left the Palace at around 1am and went to the nearest Circle K - a convenience store chain in Bali that are generally open 24 hours a day. I sat outside with various locals talking about their lives here and mine back home in Tasmania - in rather broken English i might add, so a lot of it was mimed which was great fun. After a good couple of hours talking as the rain torrented off the roof at our feet and our beers became empty, I went further afield exploring alleys and empty lots around Ubud. I was amazed at how safe i felt, everyone i met [all locals] simply wanted to chat or some money for a drink. Apparently, i was the tourist only one awake - which the Circle K crew found quite amusing for some reason.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately the rain made it impossible to get my camera out of my jacket to take pictures which was a shame, but the atmosphere, colours and smells were beautiful. The rain quickly washed away the smell of the sewers [which lay directly below the footpaths] leaving only the smell of rain on old stone and fresh leaves - my lungs never felt so alive! The few streetlights that were around reflected off every surface refracting and bouncing around so that the whole main street looked lit for an eerie hollywood horror movie. Again, it looked 100% different to what it looks like in the day - to the point i almost got lost on a straight road [yes, i know, awkward for me]. It was a great experience to go out at that time as i got to see a side i don't think a lot of other tourists wouldn't necessarily see. If you find yourself in Ubud around the rainy season, i well recommend a beer outside Circle K just round from the Palace, the lads will take good care of you.</p>
    <p><strong>[nggallery id=2]</strong></p>
    <p>After a few hours sleep i was awoken by an amazing pancake with chocolate and banana - which brings me to my next point. The bananas. The oranges. The pawpaw. Oh. My. Chickenballs. You haven't lived until you've tried freshly squeezed orange juice from the Ubud region - when we first got a glass we were convinced it was a mix of various fruits until the waiter proved it was just orange juice - though i may point out that they're green, not orange. And now that iv tasted what bananas should taste like, i don't think ill ever think of the pitiful excuse for 'nanas we get in Tas the same way. In fact, im going to pause writing this to get one. Brb.</p>
    <p>Back on track [it was amazing btw] - after being forced out of my 'nana pancake induced coma we headed out for [another] breakfast at - so far- my favourite restaurant where eggs florentine is only $3.50 - shit yes! Here we gorged on home made pastries and coffee which we all agreed was some of the best wed ever had. Here we planned our attack for the day and listened to Hamish reel out interesting facts about chinese population traits from the medieval ages [they actually were very interesting, no sarcasm]. We soon agreed that the Ubud Art Museum was a worthy trip for the day and set off on foot in its direction. But we were soon hindered by an antiques shop - you know what us hoarders are like, we cant resist old stuff! Me and linden bee lined to a rack of shorts made from scraps of old fabric with tassels everywhere - to my disappointment a discovered a problem with custom made clothing in Bali - they just cant imagine how fat all us westerners are compared to them. All their custom made clothes were tiny on me and linden only just fits into his because they have elastic. But these shorts were just too good to pass up and tailors over here are cheap so we bought my favourite pair to get modified to fit - i cant wait! Hamish and Clare also invested in some beautiful coins from the pre 1800's and a box brought over by the Dutch when the invaded - all in all we left the shop smily faced and heavily laden. With that in mind we decided to get a task to the museum so after some heated haggling from my auntie Clare we set off towards the museum. Which was amazing and deserves a post all of its own so head HERE to check out my post on that while i continue here about the later half of the day.</p>
    <p>After getting a Taksi back from the museum to the Palace in Ubud we went out for lunch at a place called 'Ibu Rai' - a restaurant named after a well liked local woman. Once again we were greeted with dishes fit for kings at the price of a cheeseburger at 50% off! Every dish i have here blows my mind at how cheap it is compared to eating out in Hobart - i wish i could bring the prices home :-p. We munched down our meals and parted ways to wander around - we hadn't been in this area yet so it needed to be explored. I shot down the nearest alley way and into 'suburbia' with the intention of getting lost to see what the real bali looks like. As soon as i had move a block away from the main street, everything changed. No one sprooked goods or services, the only shops were to cater for eight locals [basic foods and drinks] or to other tourism based shops [laundry services, Taksi mechanics etc]. It was fantastic. I came across all sorts of great objects and scenes like a 50s Kodak bus stop - if only it wasn't so big - i want is as my couch! Just near the bus stop i found a group of children between 5 and 9 years old practicing a costume performance they do in the streets to ward off evil spirits. We had seen older kids doing these regularly through the main street - these kids were being taught by two elders who sat smoking cloves, giving directions and laughing manically when the procession fell into disarray before re arranging them to keep practicing. The kids flocked to my camera laughing and giggling at themselves when i showed them what they looked like - it was a magical 5 minutes i will remember forever.</p>
    <p>After saying goodbye to my newfound friends and their herders i kept walking through the streets stopping here and there to have a quick chat of flick a stray dog - it was so far the most raw bali experience iv had - except perhaps my 4am circle k mission. I soon found myself in the middle of a construction site - upon which i was met with roars of laughter at the lost expression on my face and requests that i [again] take photos of their muscles as they worked. We had a nice chat and i had a cigarette while we chatted about their lives here - i was shocked [but at the same time not] at how little these boys were getting paid. For a full days hard work - in the most appalling situations - they were paid 18'000 Rp - about $1.90 AUD. Thats just enough for a can of coke or 2 litres of petrol or half a third of a meal [1 main no drinks] at any of the restaurants we have eaten in daily - i was very taken aback, even ashamed. And yet they were making merry with what they had. Nothing short of inspiring - so i bought them all a coke as a thanks for being so inviting. They also showed me around the work site though i wasn't allowed to take photos as they were scared they'd get in trouble from their boss and get fired. After taking photos of them all posing and giggling i moved on stopping quickly for a coffee and then returning home only to find the gang gathered at a distance around a green tree snake - the only deadly snake in Bali - as the local snake catcher leapt on it with a stick and grabbed it by the head quickly tossing it into a plastic bag and walking non nonchalant away grinning as we all clapped. We went out for dinner as usual but that was fairly uneventful and my fingers are tired. So until tomorrow - adieu and sleep well Tasmania.</p>
    <p>Peace.</p>
    <h1>Day 4</h1>
    <p>Today we awoke early in time to meet our guide for the day, Nyoman and his nephew. We met them through Putu - one of the people who works at the palace we are staying at. We were told that these two would be able to show us the local side of Bali - which is always more interesting than the glammed up tourist route. We set off in our two car convoy heading out of the Ubud area and into the rice fields. We drove for about an hour through villages, rice fields, light forest sections and full on jungles - it was magnificent. One village we passed through was made up primarily of carpentry and woodwork shops, some of the work i saw just from my window was beautiful - the quantity was even more spectacular.</p>
    <p>Whats fantastic over here, is that on the whole quantity of a product doesn't mean its more likely to be junk. In this village each shop front must have had hundreds of tables, carvings, stools, cabinets - you name it - but each was an individual artwork on its own. The same goes for all the art galleries/shops in Ubud - there were literally hundreds upon hundreds of pieces of work on racks. But they weren't copies of masters they were all different, the styles ranged from water colors to oils to line drawings and aerosol works. Of all my time exploring galleries and art shops iv never been into a shop that has such a diverse range of work at the quality i saw again and again in Ubud.</p>
    <p>After passing through a couple more villages full of other amazing sights and manically waving children we turned down a dirt track that lead to a community warehouse renowned for its hand crafted silver jewelery - and boy was i in for a shock. Upon arrival we were met with a line of women working on the most intricate beads and silver sculptures where we were shown the painstaking process undergone to produce a simple necklace bead. After our 1 minute 101 on silver jewelery production we went inside where all the finished pieces were. The first thing that escaped my lips when i walked through the door was meant to be some profanity but nothing came out but a slow gurgle followed by a gasp. The warehouse was filled top to bottom with glass cases housing thousands upon thousands of silver bracelets, earrings, sculptures, knives, lockets, lighters - anything you can imagine that could be made out of silver - and many you would never have thought of. We spent a good hour inside exploring the wealth of intricacy picking bits and piece to bring home. The staff were again some of the most friendly and helpful people iv ever met - and gave us some fantastic prices. Which brings me another point, the prices - i find it unfathomable how much stock was sitting in these cases seemingly going unmoved for months if not years and still charge next to nothing [comparatively to the western jewelery prices of course]. Silver isn't cheap and its not sourced from Bali it comes from Java an neighboring country. But enough on that - check out the photos to see what im rambling about.</p>
    <p>As we left the silver village we saw some kids played with home made crackers by the side of the road, they thought it would be incredibly funny to say they had none left then as i took a photo of one boy on a bike set one off just behind his legs sending him into a frenzy and scaring the buggery out of me! The kids laughed hysterically as they took turns to pose for the camera pulling faces and making fart noises - it had me  in stitches by the time i had to leave. Yet another great moment ill remember for life. We continued down the road passing through yet more beautiful villages and out into an area where there were just trees and famed forests. Our driver took us to a place where they grow fruits, spices and coffee. Whats a little unordinary about this coffee however, is that its sourced from beans that have been eaten by the native Mongoose [aka Civet Cat], passed through their system and then defecated. The locals the  collect the feces, pick out the beans, roast them and then grind them like any other coffee. Although [as some of you are well aware] i'm not a veteran coffee drinker, it tasted like no other coffee iv ever had. Its also happens to be the most expensive coffee in the world - in Paris you pay $50 USD for a cup. We paid $10 AUD over here :D for a generous cup. It was nothing short of delicious - even with no milk!</p>
    <p>[photography on my flickr in the sidebar]</p>
    <p>After buying up some poop coffee at a bargain price and patting the pet bats we ventured off once again through the backlots of Bali this time not heading anywhere in particular but putting our lives in the hands of our tame task driver who was taking us to his family home in the foothills to show us what real Balinese people live like. We ventured deeper and deeper into the hills stopping frequently to slowly manoeuvre between buses, motor bikes and cows - which I might add was no mean feat on a one way track [not a street by any standards]. We eventually stopped on a street full of barking dogs - seriously there was like 15 of the fuckers barking. We were taken through a door into an area with 5 or 6 stone buildings that would have been built around 200 odd years ago that have been passed down from generation to generation. We were shown through the kitchen - which was very basic [see pics] and then to the area where the ashes were kept. Our guide told us the story of his ancestors and how they have different areas for different family members and statues for their gods to reside in to protect their family forever. After hearing all this he showed us out back where they kept their pigs and a cow - the pigs were very tame and happy. Getting up on hind legs to gently try and nudge you - it was quite bizarre actually. I took a heap of photos around the the place and had a nice chat to one of the daughters. Ill write up another post describing the differences between our and their living styles because theres too much to say here.</p>
    <p>After saying goodbye the the family and thanking them we started our journey back to Ubud to get some well deserved rest stopping briefly by a temple where i was curtly told by a local to stop taking pervasive pictures - i was photographing a dog at the time so either he thought i looked really creepy or i totally misunderstood what he said. Im hoping for the latter.</p>
    <p>Just before we headed home some of us went to a Bali dog refuge centre. A place set up by an australian woman to care for sick and injured dogs - of which there are HEAPS. They had four enclosures - one for dogs ready to be adopted out into the world again, one for dogs who aren't sick but are still on the mend, another for sick dogs yet to be treated [which was in another location] and the last one which was for dogs that were traumatised and so are too violent to be in society. The home has a policy of not putting down ANY dogs unless its going to die for sure. They have a small staff of 4 locals who get paid even less [as if that were possible] than most in the area because the love working with the dogs. They have next to no funding and survive off donations and money out of their own pocket. What they really need is $3500 a year to lease a larger property to create a proper refuge for the dogs. Currently they work from a very small piece of land donated by a generous local. Check out their website at www.freewebs.com/balidogs - if you can please do donate [they have paypal] they need all the money they can get and sick dogs are a major health problem throughout Bali. Our family donated $100 USD which they said would be able to feed their dogs for a long time - every dollar helps.</p>
    <p>It was sad saying goodbye to our tour guides as they had been so nice to us. We would not have seen the real Bail without them. If your ever in Bali head to their website and get into contact with them - nyomantourservices.wordpress.com - you WONT regret it.</p>
    <p>Anyway, dinner is waiting for me and my fingers hurt again [i havnt written this much since high school!]</p>
    <p>Peace out Tasmania,</p>
    <p>Lova ya!</p>
    <h1>Day 5</h1>
    <p>Today was a fairly slow day as we were leaving Ubud [sad times] to get on a plane to Lombok the next stop on our sweaty adventure. We packed up our things from the Palace, had one last cup of coffee down the road at our favourite restaurant and then departed - but not before quickly stopping to taste suckling pig [which was…. interesting]. We then got into our respective Taksi's and then burned through the traffic, our driver beeping and yelling his way through the flurry of bikes, buses and cars all of which were doing the same. We managed to make it to the airport on time and in one piece - customs was once again very quick and before long we were on the half our flight to Lombok admiring the volcanos and alien terrain.</p>
    <p>As soon as we landed on Lombok - and even from the air - we could tell it was a very different place. The plant life was very different - the trees are more sparse and for want of a better phrase it was 'less jungle-y'. Although Lombok and Bali are physically very close they have a very different variety of plants and animals. This is because the straight between the two islands is so deep that it has made it impossible for animals to cross to Bali from Lombok. Lombok has a major Australasian influence where as Bali is has a more defined Asiatic fauna. I could try and write about it but id get some things wrong, its a really interesting phenomenon for those so inclined to check out 'the wallace line' on wikipedia.</p>
    <p>The traffic over here [sadly] is not as manic as in Bali because the roads are wider [who would have thought that'd be a solution aye?] and there are less people with the money for cars and bikes. One thing i noticed straight away on the roads are horses and carts! I saw none in Bali but have seen dozens in Lombok. Our Taksi drove us a short way out of Mataram [where we landed] and to a place just past Senggigi called Puri Mas Resort. It was just light enough as we walked through the garden to start to realise just how magnificent this place was though well have to wait until morning to see how it really shapes up.</p>
    <p>Im going to have a delicious dinner now before going to bed - doing nothing all day really gets to you :)</p>
    <p>Peace out Tas you crazy lovechild!</p>
    <p>ex oh ex oh gossi… DAMN YOU LOCALS AND YOUR WESTERN FIXATION!!!</p>
    <p>[no photos from today until i get my film developed]</p>
    <h1>Day 6</h1>
    <p>After i went to bed last night some of the others stayed up at the bar and got a chance to talk with the owner Marcel. He had offered to take us through his private museum in his villa - which we weren't going to say no to. So at 11 we met Marcel and were taken on an antique tour of a lifetime. Theres more than a daily journal posts worth from that trip so head <a title="Marcels Villa Tour - Antiques, Minimalism and Symmetry " href="http://travel.jonnyscholes.com/?p=32" target="_blank">HERE</a> to check out what we saw there while i get on with Day 6.</p>
    <p>After the villa tour Marcel also took us to a few other places around the resort including the new gym and library under construction, the temples and finally through what looked like a service door into a small courtyard filled with the cutest puppies iv ever seen [except of course for dray - oh how i miss her]. The local guard dog had managed to escape and frolic with a dog next door which happened to be a Rottweiler too so Puri Mas is now home to 8 Rottweiler puppies. We spent a good 45 minutes cuddling and giggling at the puppies fall over each other as the fought to play with us - or more specifically Lindens dreads! It was very cute.</p>
    <p>After dragging ourselves away from the puppies we all parted ways to relax and do absolutely nothing for the afternoon. I went of for a bit of a walk around the coast chatting here and there with some local surfers, Linden went for [another] surf while the elders swam in the infinity pool - not exactly sure why its called that but i like it so it stays.</p>
    <p>We have a big day planned tomorrow so we sat down to an early dinner - which once again topped all our expectations. I GOT NAAN BREAD! WITHOUT EVEN ASKING!! I was very chuffed. Until my family decided it would be funny to play hide the naan bread. To which i threatened to mount the table and perform all sorts of treacherous acts until the naan mysteriously appeared back on my plate. Which brings me to now, everyones in bed and im sitting at the bar drinking cheap cosmos and writing this post. Although i can predict the future, i better not as all sorts of bad things generally come of that - but thats another story for another blog.</p>
    <p>Well, thats it from me today - i plan to finish my cosmo and goto bed. Much like most of you are already doing.</p>
    <p>Until we meet again Tasmania,</p>
    <p>Selamat malam dan mengisap penisku - goodnight.</p>
    <h1>Marcels Villa Tour - Day 6 [no pix yet internet here is being very flaky]</h1>
    <p>This tour deserves a blog post all of its own because it was such amazing and jam packed tour - and there are many who may well want to skip the whole antiques rave that is set to begin in 5 minutes. Got your popcorn ready? Good lets roll.</p>
    <p>Puri Mas is owned by a man called Marcel de Rijk who is of Dutch decent and who's family has had long standing ties with Indonesia. Over his lifetime he has built various luxury hotels around the world including the rejuvenation of a French castle and a resort in Morocco. 5 or so years ago he decided it was too much having business' at 4 corners of the globe and that he needed to focus on one or two areas. He sold up all but his operations here in Lombok and in Holland where he comes from.</p>
    <p>Marcel is a really interesting man having been an world class dancer, then vice president of the World Dance Council and is now an avid art lover, international dance judge around the world and a collector of some of the worlds most rare and beautiful artefacts. He gave us the amazing opportunity to walk through his private collection at his side as he explained where and how he came about his insane collection.</p>
    <p>3 years ago when he sold the castle in France - where a lot of his collection was kept - he decided to bring it all over to Indonesia. One reason being that he was here a lot and wished to admire it, but also because of the nature of a lot of the items it was a lot less trouble as Indonesian laws are quite loose regarding old swords, guns and religious material. Hence the move to Lombok - however his collection was HUGE [seriously, see the pics] and he had no space anywhere in the resort here to house it. So in the year it took to put all the work together and get it shipped here he [well the locals at his expense] created the most AMAZING villa i have ever seen [even in the movies]. He calls it the presidential villa - it was opened by Indonesia's ex-prime minister which subsequently gave it the name. Its not a place that just anyone can lease you must be someone of importance - when its not being let out to the influential [not necessarily the rich mind you - just who he deems important] it is his sisters home away from Holland.</p>
    <p>We entered through the back entrance which looked out over the sea. Upon opening the heavy wooden doors to reveal the first glimpse of the amazing space we were about to see. The gate opens up into a classic European courtyard that would usually have a fountain but instead has the most beautiful blue tiled pool iv ever seen with a selection of Indonesian and stress and grasses arranged symmetrically around its edge. At your feet as you step across the threshold are stepping stones poking out from the turquoise green moat that extends to the left and right. In the water lying atop granite stones a fantastic antique vase from morocco shimmers in the light underwater.</p>
    <p>We were led to the left where the lounge room and kitchen open up to the courtyard - there are bamboo screens that can be folded down in the wind but for the most part it stays open allowing for the air to circulate around the building. The building itself is very modern and minimalist using only whites, blues and pinks that gives a soft vibe to the area. In striking contrast the furniture and decorations are a mix of thousand year old relics in glass cases to beautiful lamps from the turn of the century. The kitchen although decked out with the latest in modern cooking equipment is filled once again with amazing antiquities from around the globe. Behind the table hangs a huge painting of a traditional rifle jousting ceremony from morocco to which Marcel motions that he also has one of these original rifles in another room - which only tantalized us further. He stopped at each piece and explained what it was, how he got it and why he liked it - some of the tales he told of crossing borders on foot to bypass various laws were much akin to the stories my dad has told me of his stone tool collecting days.</p>
    <p>Marcel proceeded to take us upstairs where another main living area was. The top level was completely symmetrical - down the dotted i and crossed t - at each end stood antique opium beds where people would play cards, drink tea and smoke opium back when that was a done thing in the Australasian area. The center chandelier is apparently world renowned and incredibly valuable - on its journey over here from France part of it broke which he had fixed by an international export he flew over specially - his dedication to his collection is nothing short of inspiring. The room also had cabinets full of various pieces from his childhood or [again] ancient relics - he motioned to one cabinet filled with an array of beautiful antique dolls, wooden toys and china nonchalantly waving it off as a lesser part of his collection before proceeding to tell us the arduous tale of getting the incredibly heavy furniture moved from around the world. So important to him was presentation and symmetry that he had Balinese woodworkers make similar copies of various shelves and book cases - which although not as old were nothing short of breath taking. It was impressive how well they had done to considering the shapes and carvings were not of Indonesian origin.</p>
    <p>I could go on and on about the various other rooms filled with ancient paintings, rare artifacts and souvenirs from his incredibly expansive travels but wed be here all week and i have a holiday to get to [hah!]. By far the most impressive room was his purpose built museum. All eight of us - to his delight - gasped and exclaimed upon entering yet another beautifully lit and designed room lined with glass cases that held all sorts of objects. Words cannot to justice to the things we saw and were able to handle - my favorites being some chinese miniatures and a copy of the Koran with a handcrafted silver case. We spent a good hour or so musing through his collection and trading stories - at one point he exclaimed he'd never had guests so knowledgeable about these sorts of things let alone this interested. I guess he found the right bunch though, a historian, a writer, a film maker, two doctors and a geographer - not to mention me and Linden who are, well were just awesome.</p>
    <p>I think ill let the pictures do the rest, the bar awaits. Enjoy. And if your ever in Lombok -www.purimas-lombok.com - look em up. Marcel will look after you.</p>

    <h1>Day 7</h1>
    <p>Today we woke up in reasonable time [around 9.30am] to get in yet another Taksi driven by a cheery local to take a trip to the largest city in Lombok - Mataram. We were mainly on the hunt for antiques - which were said to be cheap when found in lies at various markets around the city as the locals don't know their real worth.</p>
    <p>We told our driver that we were looking for old stuff not new tourist gear - much to his surprise. He first took us to an alleyway he said had a few places along it. We arrived down a tiny one way back road littered with old cans, broken down cars and remnants of structures that presumably were once stalls to cater to the now non existent tourist crowd. We stopped outside a place with a sign that once would have said antiques but was now covered in graffiti and political posters. At first it was closed - like every other place on the street - but the persistence of our driver paid off and a local told him he would fetch the owner. A man appeared bright eyed and smiling broadly from around the corner and opened up the shop for us. Inside it was dimly lit via a few holes in the roof and the main door. There were piles upon piles of unorganised 'stuff' most of it at least 20 or 30 years old with some pieces even older. We spent a good hour looking through the piles and collecting a mass of stuff we wished to purchase together.  Among the best finds was a fantastic Indonesian calendar carved in wood that showed the moon cycles, months, holidays - everything. It was magnificent.</p>
    <p>Our pile grew steadily over the time we were there and eventually wed picked the place dry of all its worth - at least in our eyes. The man in charge was ecstatic at how much we had bought  - i doubt he'd seen a paying customer in years! We spent over a million Rps there [around $160 AUD]. Although he was waiting for us to haggle the price down, we refused as we knew we were already getting a fantastic price - much to his delight. As we handed over the money HE took off 100'000 Rp as a gesture - and his daughter came forward with necklaces for us all for which we were very grateful. We collected our stuff and said a prolonged good bye to yet another set of friends were sure never to forget.</p>
    <p>After negotiating our way slowly out of the alleyway our driver took us to a local market where dad had been some 10 years ago when he was shooting footage for a film. Naturally, a lot has changed in 10 years and now that no tourists go to Mataram, this market only had food and clothing, along with other essentials for local living like hairdressers and bike part shops. This for me was actually the highlight of my time in Mataram [and indeed my time away so far] and i wish we could have spent some more time just wandering around. The smells were fantastic - not that they smelled nice [i assure you, they did not] but it summed up the last 30 odd years the market must have been in place. It was defiantly a culture shock to see how these people do their shopping compared to the pristine aisles of Woolies and Coles back home.</p>
    <p>This market was nothing like id ever seen - and made salamanca market look like a 200 million dollar shopping complex in comparison. Stalls were made up of cardboard or wooden boxes lined with leaves or newspaper which held the produce. The roofs were obviously semi permanent, made from bits of tarpaulin, hole ridden corrugated iron and if the stall holder was luck and actual roof held up by bamboo struts. It cant have offered much protection from the torrential rain that comes down 6 months in the year. As we ducked and weaved our way through the market we began to realise that EVERYONE in the market was looking at us. Either pointing at linden's and my bare chests or yelling at dads sarong which he was later informed was tied like a girls one. Some of us relished the attention talking back jestingly with locals - while others weren't so happy with our new found audience.  What was also fantastic about this market, was it was the first time we hadn't been inundated by requests to by produce or give money to feed their children. The locals seemed content with sitting back and making jokes at our expense - as were we.</p>
    <p>The people here must have iron lined stomaches or an immune system with the Balrog [may he rest in peace] as its ally. The fruit was covered in dirt and flies - the nuts and rice spilled from their baskets onto the dirty floor where it was scooped from and sold. I came across one stall that sold nothing but dried fish - which as far as i was concerned could have been picked up from the beach after a nasty storm [it REALLY stank, that smell i could have done without]. It was in no way sanitary or organised - which made it fascinating to observe.</p>
    <p>Our driver led us deeper and deeper into this - seemingly - nervier ending market. The alley ways between stall sections were covered in bubble gum graffiti and games of tic tac toe obviously played by the bored children as their parents tried to make a modest living. We were on the hunt for any left over junk shops from when Mataram was the tourist capital - we found places selling replicas and i saw some fantastic heirlooms around a woman's neck but nothing of sufficient interest to the historians in the group to warrant any lingering attention - much to the stallholders dismay. I did how ever give out a solid wad cash in dribs and drabs to the women i saw with kids and a blind man at a make shift soup bar so our appearance was not totally pointless in the locals minds. I may point out that locals like anyone getting tipped or donated money as it brings more money into the system in which they work. As far as i could tell, apart from us and a few people at the soup bar, everyone was selling - not buying. Although like in the Ubud locals market i saw a fair amount of trading and bartering between stall holders. A sentiment i strongly hope comes back to the western world in a strong way over coming years.</p>
    <p>After spending 15 or so minutes wandering around this market we moved on - although i could have spent all day there the others were on a hunt for antiques and there were none there - so we moved on. From the market we drove through the city in search of place we were told about called Harrys Antiques - for some reason 'Harrys _______' was a very popular name in Lombok and Bali it was quite strange. We drove through the heart of Mataram which was nothing short of fascinating - once again i wish we could have walked through the city but there wasn't enough time. The whole city seemed to be in a constant state of repair or construction - though it looked like many buildings that were under going that treatment had been left abandoned half way through or only had a one or two workers on deck at any given time. It is well known here that if something is to be done 'by the end of the month' at least quadruple that and you may find the work completed [at least this was Marcels view on the matter]. Our driver eventually got us to the famed Harrys Antiques upon which the vultures defended on the wares once again picking out the best bits and bobs, piling them up and coming to a price. After bundling up our second set of unusually cheap antiques we set off home after a day jam packed that could be deemed nothing short of a sensory overload - it was magnificent.</p>
    <p>The afternoon consisted of lazing around the restaurant eating amazing food and drinks at ludicrously cheap prices and for me finishing the previous days post [i honestly don't know where im getting the time to do all this writing!] For dinner wed booked a special meal offer by Puri Mas which is essentially a large platter of various indonesian dishes. We were taken to the other resort campus where we were met with a beautifully lit, private area with a low lying table we sat cross legged at, an opium couch like the ones we saw in Marcels joint and an amazing spa [although i crashed out on the couch before getting as far as the spa]. Dinner was - once again - amazing. Dish after dish made me drool - which is a rare sight for anyone who knows me!</p>
    <p>Well, once again iv run out of things to say! So ill leave you all to continue with your lives as i relish the cheap food, endless sun and grinning locals.</p>
    <p>Peace out Tasmania!</p>
    <p>-J!</p>
    <h1>Day 8</h1>
    <p>Today we left Puri Mas in Senggigi for Kuta - in Lomboks south. Linden and Kate were both still ill from the day before so the morning was a bit hectic but we managed to get checked out in time to enjoy one last lunch at the hands of Puri Mas' master chef.</p>
    <p>The drive from Senggigi was a 2 hour one so we stocked up on water and ate as much as we could. The 8 seater was jam packed with antiques, baggage and a surf board so it was a tight squeeze to get all of us in there to. I was situated at the far back right with a surfboard to my immediate left segregating me from the rest of the party - which i didn't mind as i had a big window to lean out of and so it was just an excuse to ignore my families cry for me to stop blatantly photographing people [of which some didn't like].</p>
    <p>This was our first long drive through a large and varied part of Lombok. We went through a bunch of villages and rice fields where people were working. It was very different to a similar length trip we did in Bali. The villages here catered only for the locals. No lines of gimmicky gift shops, the children stared confused at white people being out so far as opposed to following dancing and jumping [although there was one or two grouped who did that], the elder locals seldom waved or returned my greetings - out of angst or miscommunication i don't know but it was a very different vibe.</p>
    <p>The vegetation changed a great deal over the trip as well, in the North - nearer to Mataram and Senggigi where wed been staying most of of the forest was farmed. Not in the way we farm - it was selectively farmed depending on what grew best at any given spot. From up close you couldn't really tell it was farmed unless you already knew  - even then it was hard to see exactly what was harvested each season. From further back however, you started to see patterns of trees and vegetation - for example lines of coconut trees too straight to be natural or semi rectangular sections of ploughed earth in the middle of a jungle was also a dead give away. Its all put together in a way that it self seeds year in year out - so the locals only have to harvest their crops and have little to worry about the rest of the year. Each tree and plant belongs to someone even if the land its self is shared - how they work out who's is who's i have no idea i haven't seen any sign of markings on trees - they must all have great memories!</p>
    <p>Down towards Kuta the plants began to change too, the trees were more sparse and the wet, jungle feel started to dry out to a much more Australasian forrest look [again, the wallace line comes into play here and wikipedia explains it better than i ever could].  There was also much less farming going on -   that is changing rapidly though dad tells me. He was here around 12 years ago and apparently back then as soon as you left the outlying villages as you headed South there was absolutely no farming - now however there are small patches dotted the whole way - but nothing like the farmed land of Bali or Northern Lombok.</p>
    <p>Along the way we passed what will soon be the new international airport which is scheduled to be completed in 2 years [so it will probably be done around 2015] . They are also in the middle of building a highway between the region Kuta is in and Mataram. This is all being pushed by the government and outside investors - not the locals. Lombok is fast becoming the next Bali - and as soon as the international airport is finished it will unfortunately become yet another tourist hot spot. The locals as you can imagine are not happy about this - going so far as to put a 'hit' out on a developer who has pushed many locals into selling up their family land around the foreshore [the real threat of the contract i don't know but we've heard it from a few people now]. In Kuta its self among the foreshore are a heap of restaurants, clothes shops and warungs [the equivalent of a take away joint] - all these places will be bulldozed in coming years. The owners and workers will receive no compensation. They will not get relocated. They will be thrown out and quite literally told to fuck off. Its disgusting. But, unfortunately, there is nothing that can be done. Their buildings are built on government land - but not government land in the sense we know. For as long as the locals here can remember, everyone has 'squatted' - the only people [apart from a select few] who OWN land are people from over seas. The locals have been left alone for the last 30 odd years to do as they please because there has been no incentive for the government to kick them off the land. Until Lombok was discovered for its surfing, diving and culture - much like what happened in Bali. To that effect, the government i using 'its right to the land' to kick the pro locals out and make way for yet another tourist strip. Woot? I think not.</p>
    <p>Once we got to Kuta it was fairly late, we just had time to check into our 'resort' - which was by no means even 3 star but oh well, the staff were nice and it had aircon. We couldn't complain. Though staff, if your reading this, PLEASE get rid of the mosquito incubator you try and pass off as a fountain, it doesn't look, smell, feel or taste good and certainly isn't doing you any favours. We met a couple of aussies who pointed us towards a resteraunt they said wouldn't try to kill us with ecoli invested lettuce. We had a quick dinner there before returning to our new found temporary home to crash out - although before quite getting to bed Linden and i discovered the wonders of Indoneseian late night television. SBS aint got shit on 555tv… and bold and the beautiful would win oscars a plenty compared to whatever soap we were trying to watch. It was quite the hilarity.</p>
    <p>Anyway, this post is long enough - i don't want to bore you too much.</p>
    <p>Tomorrow we go boating - hurrah!</p>
    <p>Until next time,</p>
    <p>PEOICE!!</p>
    <p>p.s. A note for the Lombok government - stop building roundabouts, your drivers categorically refuse to use them… even when its more convenient to do so. k thnx bay!</p>
